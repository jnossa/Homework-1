PD: first we checked the procedure with a not DRY code to make sure it worked and afterwards we made it DRY. Find below the not DRY part of the code:

for country in list_of_plus_500:
    ratio = int(country[2]) / int(country[1])
    death_confirmed_ratio_500.append(ratio)

for country in list_of_plus_1000:
    ratio = int(country[2]) / int(country[1])
    death_confirmed_ratio_1000.append(ratio)

for country in list_of_plus_5000:
    ratio = int(country[2]) / int(country[1])
    death_confirmed_ratio_5000.append(ratio)

average_500 = sum(death_confirmed_ratio_500) / len(death_confirmed_ratio_500)
average_1000 = sum(death_confirmed_ratio_1000) / len(death_confirmed_ratio_1000)
average_5000 = sum(death_confirmed_ratio_5000) / len(death_confirmed_ratio_5000)

print(f'The average ratio of deaths to confirmed cases is:\nFor countries above 500 active cases: {round(average_500 * 100, 2)}%\nFor countries above 1000 active cases: {round(average_1000 * 100, 2)}%\nFor countries above 5000 active cases: {round(average_5000 * 100,2)}%')
